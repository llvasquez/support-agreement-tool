# Agreement Workflow Engine

This document provides an overview of the Agreement Workflow Engine, which is designed to automate the routing, review, approval, and signature processes for agreements.

## Overview

The Agreement Workflow Engine is a flexible, event-driven system that manages the lifecycle of agreements through configurable workflows. It provides:

- **Workflow Templates**: Reusable workflow definitions that can be applied to different agreements
- **Task Management**: Assignment and tracking of tasks to users
- **Notifications**: Real-time notifications for workflow events
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive history of all workflow activities

## Architecture

The workflow engine is built using a modular architecture with the following components:

### Core Components

1. **Workflow Definition Service**: Manages workflow templates
2. **Workflow Execution Engine**: Creates and manages workflow instances
3. **Task Management Service**: Manages user tasks and assignments
4. **Notification Service**: Sends notifications based on workflow events

### Data Models

The key data models in the system are:

- **WorkflowTemplate**: Defines the stages and rules for a workflow
- **WorkflowInstance**: A running instance of a workflow for a specific agreement
- **StageInstance**: A stage within a workflow instance
- **TaskAssignment**: A task assigned to a user
- **WorkflowEvent**: An event that occurred during workflow execution

## Workflow Templates

Workflow templates define the stages, approvers, and routing logic for a workflow. They can be customized for different agreement types and scenarios.

### Example Workflow Template

```json
{
  "id": "standard-moa-review",
  "name": "Standard MOA Review Process",
  "description": "Standard review process for Memorandum of Agreement",
  "agreementTypes": ["MOA"],
  "stages": [
    {
      "id": "initial-draft",
      "name": "Initial Draft Review",
      "description": "Initial review of the draft agreement by the program manager",
      "order": 0,
      "type": "APPROVAL",
      "approvers": {
        "roles": ["PROGRAM_MANAGER"],
        "approvalType": "ALL",
        "reassignmentAllowed": true,
        "delegationAllowed": true
      },
      "timeConstraints": {
        "durationHours": 72,
        "workingHoursOnly": true,
        "allowExtension": true,
        "maxExtensionHours": 24
      },
      "defaultTransition": "legal-review"
    },
    {
      "id": "legal-review",
      "name": "Legal Review",
      "description": "Review of the agreement by legal counsel",
      "order": 1,
      "type": "APPROVAL",
      "approvers": {
        "roles": ["LEGAL_REVIEWER"],
        "approvalType": "ALL",
        "reassignmentAllowed": true,
        "delegationAllowed": false
      },
      "timeConstraints": {
        "durationHours": 120,
        "workingHoursOnly": true,
        "allowExtension": true,
        "maxExtensionHours": 48
      },
      "conditionalRouting": {
        "condition": "${workflow.variables.containsClassifiedData} == true",
        "trueTransition": "security-review",
        "falseTransition": "partner-review"
      }
    }
    // Additional stages...
  ]
}
```

## Workflow Execution

When a workflow is started for an agreement, the system:

1. Creates a workflow instance based on the selected template
2. Activates the first stage
3. Creates task assignments for the approvers
4. Sends notifications to the assignees
5. Tracks the progress of the workflow

As tasks are completed, the workflow progresses through its stages according to the routing logic defined in the template.

## API Endpoints

The workflow engine provides the following API endpoints:

### Workflow Templates

- `GET /api/workflow-templates`: Get all workflow templates
- `POST /api/workflow-templates`: Create a new workflow template
- `GET /api/workflow-templates/:id`: Get a specific workflow template
- `PUT /api/workflow-templates/:id`: Update a workflow template
- `PATCH /api/workflow-templates/:id/status`: Activate/deactivate a workflow template
- `POST /api/workflow-templates/:id/clone`: Clone a workflow template

### Workflow Instances

- `POST /api/workflow-instances`: Start a new workflow instance
- `GET /api/workflow-instances`: Get all workflow instances
- `GET /api/workflow-instances/:id`: Get a specific workflow instance
- `POST /api/workflow-instances/:id/cancel`: Cancel a workflow instance
- `GET /api/workflow-instances/:id/history`: Get workflow history

### Tasks

- `GET /api/tasks`: Get tasks assigned to the current user
- `GET /api/tasks/:id`: Get a specific task
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/complete`: Complete a task
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/reassign`: Reassign a task

## User Interface

The workflow engine includes the following UI components:

- **Workflow Dashboard**: Displays workflows, tasks, and notifications
- **Workflow Detail**: Shows the details and progress of a workflow
- **Task Detail**: Allows users to review and complete tasks

## Integration with Agreement Management

The workflow engine integrates with the agreement management system to:

- Start workflows for new agreements
- Update agreement status based on workflow progress
- Generate documents for signature
- Track agreement versions

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the workflow engine include:

1. **Advanced Routing Rules**: More sophisticated conditional routing based on agreement content
2. **Machine Learning**: Predictive routing and timeline estimation
3. **External Integrations**: Integration with e-signature platforms and external systems
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Comprehensive reporting and analytics

## Getting Started

To use the workflow engine:

1. Define workflow templates for your agreement types
2. Configure user roles and permissions
3. Start workflows for agreements
4. Monitor and manage workflows through the dashboard

## Development

To extend or modify the workflow engine:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run the development server with `npm start`
4. Make changes to the code
5. Run tests with `npm test`
